### 🚀 About Me
<br/>  

I am a passionate learner in Web Development, currently focusing on building projects to improve my skills. I have completed HTML, CSS, and SCSS, and I’m now exploring JavaScript to strengthen my frontend development journey.
So far, I have completed 5 projects, including:

✅ Gym Website
✅ Portfolio Website
✅ Restaurant Websites
✅ Perfect Responsive Design project

Through these projects, I have learned how to write clean, maintainable code and create responsive designs that work across all devices.<br/> 
💡 Coding is not just my skill—it’s my hobby. I enjoy experimenting with new ideas, solving problems, and continuously improving my craft. My next goal is to dive deeper into JavaScript and start working with real-world client projects.

I’m always open to learning, collaborating, and connecting with professionals in the web development community. 🚀
