### Hi there 👋, Shipon Roy

I am currently learning HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript to become a skilled web developer. I have built 5 websites using CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean code, responsive design, and excellent user experience. Client satisfaction and continuous learning are my top priorities.
